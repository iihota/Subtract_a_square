# Subtract_a_square
Subtract a square. This is a two-player mathematical game of strategy. It is played by two  people with a pile of coins (or other tokens) between them. The players take turns removing  coins from the pile, always removing a non-zero square number of coins (1, 4, 9, 16, â€¦). The  player who removes the last coin wins. (by python).
